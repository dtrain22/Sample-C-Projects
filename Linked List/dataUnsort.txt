this is a test this is only a test do not panic do not pass go do collect
two hundred dollars the data in this file is to be used to test the list
class I need more words so that I can check it out with more values than
previously used to validate the list functions the more the better because
we need to have plenty of stuff for the example values after all it is
generally necessary to find out if a class works for large sets
now lets add even more to this file of nonsense by making it bigger we can
generate an even better trial for the linked list program some new data
will help extend the length of the list so that it fills even more of the
screen as it executes
